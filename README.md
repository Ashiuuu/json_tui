# Json_tui

This is a simple and dirty tool to view Json files. It can:
- Pretty print Json files, no matter the base format
- Fold any object or array contained in the file
- Highlight current line and scroll the view accordingly
- [TODO] Search for some text in the file

Mappings:
- `<Up>` and `<Down>` to navigate
- `h` to toggle highlighting
- `<Enter>` to collapse/expand currently highlighted object
- `q` to quit
